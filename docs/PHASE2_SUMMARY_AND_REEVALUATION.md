## Re-evaluation: Next Steps

### Option A: Continue with Traditional Methods (Recommended)

**Rationale**: We now have proven patterns. Adapting remaining 8 traditional methods would be straightforward and provide comprehensive coverage.

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 days
- Each method: 4-8 hours (following established pattern)
- Methods remaining:
  1. Iterative3DWatershed
  2. Clumps2D
  3. ExpandingRings
  4. Watershed2D
  5. Threshold
  6. LoG (Laplacian of Gaussian)
  7. DoG (Difference of Gaussian)
  8. GaussianFilter

**Benefits**:
- Complete traditional method coverage
- Validated, battle-tested algorithms
- Faster than DL for many use cases
- No external dependencies

### Option B: Add More Deep Learning Methods

**Remaining methods from plan**:
1. **DeepImageJ** - Generic DL framework integration
2. **StarDist** - Star-convex object detection

**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 days
- DeepImageJ: 3-4 days (new framework)
- StarDist: 3-4 days (similar to Cellpose)

**Benefits**:
- Broader deep learning coverage
- StarDist excellent for nuclei
- DeepImageJ allows user models

**Challenges**:
- More complex dependencies
- Additional Python environments
- Longer testing cycles

### Option C: Focus on Testing and Polish

**Activities**:
1. Create test datasets
2. Validate stitching quality
3. Performance benchmarking
4. User documentation
5. Example workflows
6. Bug fixes

**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days

**Benefits**:
- Production-ready code
- User-friendly
- Confidence in implementation
- Clear documentation

### Option D: Hybrid Approach (Recommended for Next Phase)

**Phase 3 Proposal**:
1. Week 1-2: Adapt 4-5 most important traditional methods
2. Week 2-3: Testing, documentation, and polish
3. Week 3-4: Add StarDist (if time permits)

**Rationale**:
- Balances breadth and quality
- Prioritizes user needs
- Leaves advanced DL as future work
